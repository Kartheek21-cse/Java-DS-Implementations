About:

This repository contains my implementations of important Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts using Core Java.
I have implemented major List, Stack, Queue, Searching, and Sorting algorithms manually from scratch without using built-in Java methods.

Topics Covered:

1. Data Structures
   
ArrayList (custom implementation)

Singly Linked List

Doubly Linked List

Stack (using array and linked list)

Queue (using array and linked list)

2. Algorithms
   
Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Linear Search

Binary Search

Technologies Used
Language: Java

IDE: VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse

How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Kartheek21-cse/Java-DS-Implementations.git
Open the project in any Java IDE.

Compile and run the Java files containing main() methods to test the implementations.

Why this repository?

>Strengthening DSA and Core Java concepts.

>Preparing for coding interviews and placement drives.

>Building strong problem-solving skills.

"Mastering Data Structures is the first step towards mastering problem solving."
